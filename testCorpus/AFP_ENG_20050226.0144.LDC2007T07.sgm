Bangladeshi clerics support crackdown on suspected hardliners
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Leading clerics at mosques across  Bangladesh backed Saturday a
government crackdown on suspected  Muslim hardliners, saying those
engaging in terrorist acts in the  name of religion should be
punished.
</P>
<P>
"Islam does not support any act of terrorism. Those who are  engaged
in terrorism using Islam's name are nothing but terrorists.  They
should be punished for their crimes," a statement by the  country's
101 head clerics, or imam, said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The statement followed the recent arrests of suspected Islamic
hardliners throughout the Muslim-majority country.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, the government banned two hardline groups, the  Jamaatul
Mujaheedin and Jagrata Muslim Janata Bangladesh, and  arrested more
than 100 including alleged Jamaatul Mujaheedin leader  Asadullah
Ghalib.
</P>
<P>
The crackdown came as the country's donors met in Washington to
express concern at "deteriorating governance situation, political
violence and climate of impunity" in Bangladesh.
</P>
<P>
The government alleged that the two groups were involved in a  wave of
bombings of non-governmental groups, holy shrines and other  targets.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, the imams expressed their concerns at the  recent
spate of killings and bomb attacks across the country and  said, "No
group has the right to take law into its own hands".
</P>
<P>
"The imams who know anything about Islamic Shariah (law) do not
support terrorist acts. We detest all criminal activities and urge
the government to take legal action against those involved in these
crimes," it said.
