ALGIERS, Algeria (AP)
</P>
<P>
Algerian authorities searching for 31 European tourists who vanished
in the Sahara Desert found what appears to be their abandoned
vehicles, clothing and food items, the interior minister was quoted as
saying Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The fate of the tourists themselves remained unclear after comments by
the minister, Noureddine Yazid Zerhouni, appeared to cast doubt on
whether they were alive.
</P>
<P>
``All, or at least some, are still alive,'' he told a parliamentary
commission Tuesday, without elaborating. The remarks were published
Wednesday by Liberte newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The minister also reiterated a government denial that negotiations
were underway with the presumed kidnappers, as had been previously
reported by Algerian media.
</P>
<P>
The desert travelers, who had set off in seven separate groups in
four-wheel drive vehicles or on motorcycles, disappeared starting in
mid-February. None had hired guides.
</P>
<P>
Last week, a ranking Algerian official told The Associated Press that
the tourists  _  15 Germans, 10 Austrians, four Swiss, one Dutch and a
Swede  _  were being held in the Illizi region near the Libyan border.
</P>
<P>
Massive search efforts continued in an area of some 250,000 sq.
kilometers (100,000 sq. miles), Zerhouni said. About 5,000 soldiers,
police and local guides were scouring the area aided by three planes
and three helicopters in round-the-clock searches.
</P>
<P>
Recent discoveries included six vehicles, all of which were stripped
of their batteries, canned food items and clothing, which officials
believe belonged to the tourists, Zerhouni said.
</P>
<P>
He said the items were found last week.
</P>
<P>
It was not clear if the six vehicles cited by Zerhouni included one
that was reported discovered last week. An Algerian security official
said last week a four-wheel drive vehicle, a blue Ivecco, was found
``practically buried in the sand,'' also with its battery removed.
</P>
<P>
Liberte also quoted Zerhouni as saying a search party had discovered a
stash of arms and ``contraband'' in the desert, without providing
details.
</P>
<P>
Zerhouni said the vast area was known to be ``filled with smugglers,''
some with connections to the Salafist Group for Call and Combat, or
GSPC, an Islamic extremist group that has been linked to al-Qaida.
</P>
<P>
There has been speculation that Islamic rebels battling the military-
backed government for more than a decade might be behind the
disappearances, event though the Sahara region has been free of
attacks.
