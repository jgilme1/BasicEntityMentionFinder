Russia's drugs control chief called for bringing back Soviet-era
policies mandating medical treatment for addicts, saying it would save
their lives and prevent them from committing violence, Russian news
agencies reported Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Gen. Viktor Cherkesov, head of the Federal Drug Control Service, said
that officials would have to rally support from the public for
spending government funds on treating the addicts, according to
Interfax and RIA-Novosti.
</P>
<P>
"I regard this as a serious possibility for saving people and not as a
harshening of state policy," Cherkesov was quoted as saying by RIA-
Novosti. "This is necessary, this is saving a person when it is
impossible to live with him, when it is impossible to watch how he
dies or wait for when he takes up a knife."
</P>
<P>
Similar policies were used in the Soviet Union and even after its
collapse, in Russia, until the 1990s, he said.
</P>
<P>
The drugs chief also said between 700,000 and 800,000 addicts die of
overdoses every year, RIA-Novosti reported. Officials estimate more
than 4 million Russians are now drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Russia has seen a sharp increase in the flow of
illegal drugs, mainly Afghan opium and heroin smuggled through Central
Asia.
</P>
<P>
Cherkesov lamented that Russian law enforcement authorities were often
involved in drug trafficking, saying about 500 such officers have been
put on trial in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against illegal trade in drugs would have been more
effective, if (our) employees didn't run into corrupt police,"
Cherkesov was quoted as saying by the ITAR-Tass news agency.
