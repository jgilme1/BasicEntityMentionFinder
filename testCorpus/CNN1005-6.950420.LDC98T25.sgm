At the State Department, some word has gone out to U.S. far-flung
personnel. CNN's Steve Hurst joins us now from State. Steve?

Indeed, Reid, the State Department put out overnight a warning to
all U.S. missions abroad to take all necessary measures to beef
up security at those installations. When asked what kind of
security instructions were sent out, a source here at the State
Department said that was left to each individual mission,
thinking that they knew best how to take care of their security.
It's interesting to note that those installations, after recent
terrorist attacks around the world, in years past, have already
beefed up security almost to the point where it's hard to imagine
that where would be more.   The State Department also says that
an agent of the Diplomatic Security Service has been dispatched
to the scene of the Oklahoma City bombing. There was word
yesterday from Secretary of State Christopher that agents from
the counter-terrorism office here would go but it now seems that
they haven't.   I talked to an Israeli source not too long ago,
asking if there was anything reaching them that would suggest who
was behind this bombing. The Israeli source says we're just not
talking about that. We have no information at this point that
would link the bombing to any overseas organization. However,
that source did say the obvious, and what we've heard from other
people, and that is that this bombing looks a great deal like
what happened to the Jewish cultural center in Buenos Aires and
what has happened to the American embassy and the Marine barracks
in Beirut. However, the Israeli source says there is nothing to
confirm that any of those things are linked. The Israelis, of
course, offered their crack rescue squad to go to Oklahoma City,
the same group that went to the Buenos Aires explosion. So far,
there hasn't been a direct response from the United States, as it
tries to evaluate just what it needs to do.   And at the State
Department, we're still hearing from them that there is no
information that has reached the State Department or other
government agencies from the masses of cables coming in from
abroad that would in any way, at this point, link the bombing in
Oklahoma City to any international organization or any particular
region of the world. We're told that that is a conclusion that
has been reached by Secretary of State Warren Christopher from
the available evidence. We're going to have a briefing by State
Department Spokesman Nicholas Burns here in about 30 minutes, so
we may have something more from that. But keeping with the
current modus operandi, the State Department seems not to want to
do much talking about this right now. Reid?

Steve, given the natural desire to wrap everything up in a ribbon
and to find cause and effect, is it likely that State will state
what you just said, that there is no credible evidence of linkage
to any other country or place?

<SPEAKER> STEVE HURST </SPEAKER>
Well, that's what we've been hearing all morning, in a background
basis, and I think what we're going to hear in about half an hour
is that we're going to hear that very much on the record from
Nicholas Burns. And I think that we have to believe that at this
moment. We also have to believe that the State Department wants
to keep a very low profile on this, saying all along that this is
the business of the FBI.

All right, Steve Hurst at the State Department, thank you.
