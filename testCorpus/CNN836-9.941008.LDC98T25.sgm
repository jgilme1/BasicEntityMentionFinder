`-implementation of all its relevant resolutions, including full
cooperation by Iraq without interference with the United Nations
Special Commission's vital mission. The Security Council has also
received, with grave concern, reports that substantial numbers of
Iraqi troops, including units of the Iraqi Republican Guard, are
being redeployed in the direction of the border of Kuwait- with
Kuwait. The Security Council, therefore, requests the secretary
general to ensure that the United Nations Iraq/Kuwait Observation
Mission - UNICOM - redoubles its vigilance and reports
immediately any violation of the demilitarized zone established
under Resolution 687 or any potentially hostile act. The Security
Council reaffirms its commitment to the sovereignty and
territorial integrity of Kuwait. It underlines Iraq's full
responsibility to accept all the obligations contained in its
relevant resolutions and to comply therewith.' End quote.   This
statement will be issued as a document of the Security Council
under the symbol S PRST 1994 58. The Security Council has thus
concluded the present stage of its consideration of the item of
the agenda. The Security Council will remain seized of the
matter. The meeting is adjourned.
