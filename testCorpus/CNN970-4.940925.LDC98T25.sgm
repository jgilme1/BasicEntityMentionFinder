The tribes gather in memory of the long-dead king; but this year,
the annual Shaka Day commemoration threatens to tear the Zulu
nation apart. Absent from the crowds remembering the king who
founded the Zulu nation more than two centuries ago, is the
present monarch, Goodwill Zwelethini. He ordered the cancellation
of Shaka Day celebrations, following an argument with the man who
was once his prime minister,  Mangosuthu Buthelezi.  Buthelezi
defied the king, and the commemoration went ahead.   At the heart
of the dispute, is the struggle for political control in Natal
Province, a battle for the support of the country's 9,000,000
Zulus who comprise nearly a quarter of South Africa's total
population. King Zwelethini's support for Chief Buthelezi and the
country's first all-race elections earlier this year guaranteed
the vote of Zulu Loyalists for the Inkatha leader. However, in
recent months, the king appeared to have moved closer to Nelson
Mandela's African National Congress. And Chief Buthelezi was
deeply angered with the ANC leader was invited by the king to
attend the Shaka Day celebrations. It was, he believed, a major
challenge to his political authority and a threat to his Inkatha
Freedom Party.   Despite fears of renewed political violence,
Shaka Day has passed relatively peacefully. But, many of those
attending the commemoration Saturday made clear their anger at
the absent king. And the dispute among the Zulus in Natal
Province remains a major threat to a new government attempting to
create a climate of political tolerance and stability.   Mike
Hanna, CNN, Natal Province.
