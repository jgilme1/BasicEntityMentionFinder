2 Studies on Women's Health Released
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Federal health officials have released two major studies portraying
women's reproductive health, pregnancy and births in this country.
</P>
<P>
The report of 1995 birth statistics, a study released this week by the
National Center for Health Statistics of all births registered
throughout the country, found that more than 80 percent of pregnant
women received prenatal care beginning in the first trimester -- the
highest level ever -- and that the rate of caesarean deliveries
declined for the sixth year in a row to just under 21 percent of
births.
</P>
<P>
However, the study found that more than 7 percent of babies are born
with low birthweights -- weighing less than five pounds, eight ounces.
This is the same as 1994 and the highest level since 1976.
</P>
<P>
The center also last week released the 1995 National Survey of Family
Growth, a survey of nearly 11,000 women from the age of 15 to 44 on
factors affecting pregnancy and women's health in the United States.
It was the fifth such survey taken since 1973.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 60 million women of child-bearing age in the
United States. About 23 million have never married, 30 million are
currently married and 7 million have been formerly married.
