Nebraska to Review Safe-Haven Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Since July, Nebraska has allowed parents to leave children
younger than 18 at medical facilities without facing criminal
penalties. The law was intended to allow new parents to
relinquish unwanted infants, but officials have been shocked to
see it used more often by parents of adolescents, not all of them
from Nebraska.
</P>
<P>
The mother of the 12-year-old boy abandoned Saturday was the
third parent to travel from another state to give up a child.
</P>
<P>
Gov. Dave Heineman and leaders of Nebraska's state senate have
vowed to rewrite the law when the legislature reconvenes in
January  to apply only to infants up to 3 days old.
</P>
<P>
But the steady influx of abandoned teenagers -- almost all of the
children have been between ages 11 and 17 and none have been
infants -- has led some to call for a swifter revision.
</P>
<P>
State Sen. Arnie Stutman, a co-author of the "Safe Haven" law,
said it has opened his eyes to the need to give struggling
parents help.
</P>
<P>
"We need to see what services are available for people in this
situation," Stutman said. "Those people who are in need of help
need it now -- not in 30 days."
</P>
<P>
The mother of the boy abandoned this weekend, who has not been
identified, told the Lincoln Journal Star that she had hoped to
send her son to Boys Town, where she spent two years as a
teenager. She said the boy was in trouble both at school and with
police and that efforts to find help in Georgia were fruitless.
She also had tried to send him to relatives in other states.
</P>
<P>
"I've been fighting so long," the woman told the newspaper. "I
can't fight any longer."
</P>
<P>
The first out-of-state parents who abandoned a child in Nebraska
came from Council Bluffs in neighboring Iowa earlier in October;
weeks later, a mother drove to Omaha from Michigan to abandon her
child.
</P>
<P>
Both children are back in their home states. The other youths
abandoned under the law are all Nebraskans, including 10 children
abandoned by their father following the death of his longtime
wife. Some are in the state's foster-care system and others have
been placed with relatives, officials said.
</P>
<P>
Although parents are absolved of criminal responsibility for
child abandonment under the Safe Haven law, they still  might be
liable for child support, counseling or abuse charges for past
behavior, said Kathie Osterman, a spokeswoman with the state
Department of Health and Human Services.
</P>
<P>
"If they're having issues with their teenagers, this is not what
they want to be doing," she said. On Monday, Nebraska lawyers
filed papers to place the abandoned Georgia boy in the state's
dependency system.
</P>
<P>
His mother, of Smyrna, Ga., told the Star Journal that the
Nebraska law was her only hope and she didn't want it rewritten.
</P>
<P>
"Please don't change (the law) to be for only infants," she said.
"Please truly help young parents in every state. Make safe havens
more available."
