Mexico Pushes Extradition

MEXICO CITY
</P>
<P>
The government of President Felipe Calderon is extraditing drug
suspects and other fugitives to the United States at a record
pace, reflecting a quiet but seismic shift in Mexican policy that
many analysts say could help dismantle trafficking gangs.
</P>
<P>
Calderon's administration has handed over more than 150 criminal
suspects since coming to power in December 2006.
</P>
<P>
The extradition rate is double what it was before Calderon took
office. And it represents a radical policy change from a decade
ago, when Mexico, sensitive about its sovereignty, rarely handed
suspects over for prosecution in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Officials and analysts say Mexico's new posture on extradition
signals Calderon's determination to combat violent drug smuggling
groups through closer collaboration with U.S. authorities. At the
same time, the United States is promising $1.4 billion in
security aid for Mexico over three years.
</P>
<P>
"Calderon's message is, `Trust in me. I'm sending you these
people and I have the willingness to work with you,' "said Raul
Benitez, an expert on U.S.-Mexican relations at the National
Autonomous University of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
The list of suspects extradited under Calderon includes marquee
names such as Osiel Cardenas, the head of the so-called Gulf
cartel, and brothers Ismael and Gilberto Higuera Guerrero,
identified as bosses in the Tijuana-based Arellano Felix
organization.
</P>
<P>
Extradition proceedings are under way against Eduardo Arellano
Felix, an alleged kingpin captured by Mexican forces in Tijuana
after a shootout in October. U.S. officials sought his
extradition last year.
</P>
<P>
"Under the Calderon administration, we have seen a significant
increase not only in the number of extraditions, but in the
higher profile of the criminals being extradited, clearly
demonstrating that Mexico will not allow itself to be used as a
refuge or safe haven," said Antonio O. Garza Jr., the U.S.
ambassador to Mexico.
</P>
<P>
Mexico extradited 83 suspects to the United States last year and
has handed over 70 so far this year, according to U.S. figures.
Fifty-one more cases await approval by Mexican judges. In return,
U.S. authorities say that they have sent 26 wanted suspects to
Mexico this year, a record.
</P>
<P>
The jump in extraditions from Mexico is one of the few measurable
results in Calderon's war against organized crime.
</P>
<P>
The nation's drug violence, meanwhile, has worsened. The death
toll this year is more than 4,000, according to unofficial
tallies by Mexican news outlets, and there is little evidence
that Mexican forces have dislodged drug-smuggling operations from
strongholds along the U.S. border and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
In several cases, extraditing kingpins appears to have sparked
violent struggles to fill the vacuum at the top.
</P>
<P>
Members of the Gulf cartel have jostled for control since
Cardenas was extradited in early 2007. Much of the violence
convulsing Tijuana in recent months stems from clashes among
rival members after the arrests or deaths of some of the Arellano
Felix group's most powerful leaders.
</P>
<P>
"All extradition does is remove some of the top dogs, and others
step in for them," said Bruce Bagley, an international studies
professor at the University of Miami. "It might actually increase
the level of violence."
</P>
<P>
But sending high-ranking Mexican suspects to the United States
might offer the government an upper hand, other experts say.
</P>
<P>
For one thing, the extraditions remove wealthy drug chieftains
from Mexico's prison system, where they often are able to run
their enterprises with the help of cell phones, crooked prison
officials, lawyers and other intermediaries.
</P>
<P>
High-profile inmates also have bribed their way out: Joaquin "El
Chapo" Guzman, head of a drug-trafficking organization in the
northwestern state of Sinaloa, paid guards to help him escape
from a maximum-security prison in a laundry truck in 2001.
</P>
<P>
"When we have a criminal of this nature in a Mexican prison, we
run the risk that he could maintain contact with his criminal
bases," said Leopoldo Velarde, who heads the extradition division
in the Mexican attorney general's office. The idea, he said, "is
to take them out of their range."
</P>
<P>
Mexico began handing over a growing number of suspects under
Calderon's predecessor, Vicente Fox, president from 2000 to 2006.
But some legal barriers did not fall until 2005, when the Supreme
Court cleared the way for Mexico to extradite its citizens in
cases involving life terms.
</P>
<P>
Mexico no longer rules out extradition in cases that carry the
possibility of life in prison without parole, although it still
refuses to extradite if the defendant might be sentenced to
death.
</P>
<P>
Almost immediately on taking office, Calderon made it clear that
he would push for stepped-up extraditions to the United States as
the two governments began talks on an aid package to bolster
security through equipment and training.
</P>
<P>
Congress has approved $400 million as the first installment, but
the United States has not delivered it yet. Mexican officials say
the increase in extraditions is not part of the aid deal.
</P>
<P>
(Optional add end)
</P>
<P>
Winning extradition can take two years or more because U.S.
prosecutors must convince Mexican prosecutors and judges that
they have sufficient evidence to support charges. Defendants have
many opportunities for appeal.
</P>
<P>
Tijuana crime boss Benjamin Arellano Felix, arrested in 2002 and
convicted in Mexico on drug trafficking and money laundering
charges, is fighting the Calderon administration's decision in
June to approve an extradition request by U.S. authorities.
</P>
<P>
Despite its drawbacks, officials say extradition will remain a
central weapon in Mexico's drug-war arsenal. It also might prove
useful in the related battle to clean up official corruption.
</P>
<P>
Mexican prosecutors disclosed in October that they had arrested
or fired 35 officials in an elite organized-crime unit on
suspicion of tipping off Sinaloa-based traffickers. Even as they
announced the charges, authorities were working to extradite one
of the suspects, a supervisor named Miguel Colorado Gonzalez.
