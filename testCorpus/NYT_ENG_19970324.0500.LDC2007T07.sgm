U.S. TUBERCULOSIS CASES DECLINE FOR FOURTH STRAIGHT YEAR

Washington, March 24 (Bloomberg)
</P>
<P>
The number of tuberculosis cases in the U.S. fell for the fourth
straight year in 1996, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control said
today.
</P>
<P>
Cases of TB last year dropped nearly 7 percent to 21,327 from 22,860
in 1995 as the federal government increased funding for prevention and
control of the deadly disease. Spending by CDC on fighting the disease
has grown to about $145 million this year from $45 million in 1992,
the government said.
</P>
<P>
``Now that we're back on track toward eliminating TB in this country,
we need to finish the job,'' said CDC Director David Satcher.
</P>
<P>
Hoechst AG, Novartis AG, American Home Products Corp. and Eli Lilly
&amp; Co. are among the many makers of drugs to treat tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
While TB rates dropped nationwide and fell in areas such as New York
City, they rose 36 percent in Washington, D.C. and 22 percent in
Oregon, the Centers for Disease Control said.
</P>
<P>
People born outside the U.S. accounted for 37 percent of the TB cases
in this country last year, compared to 22 percent in 1986, CDC said.
Worldwide, about one in three people are infected with the organism
that causes TB, according to the World Health Organization. The
infectious disease kills nearly 3 million people annually. In the
U.S., the disease had largely been brought under control during the
20th century, with the death rate dropping to 6 per 100,000 Americans
in 1960 from 195 per 100,000 at the turn the century.
</P>
<P>
Yet the disease began to reemerge in the U.S. after cutbacks in
funding for prevention and control of the disease. Drug-resistant
forms of the disease have since emerged.
</P>
<P>
A deadly strain resistant to the best anti-TB drugs has spread from
New York City, Florida and New Jersey to other parts of the country,
including South Carolina, North Carolina, Colorado, Ohio,
Pennsylvania, Georgia, Nevada, California and Puerto Rico.
