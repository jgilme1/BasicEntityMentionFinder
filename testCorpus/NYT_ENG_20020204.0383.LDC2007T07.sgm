BUSH INCREASES HEALTH SPENDING WITH BULK DEDICATED TO
</HEADLINE>

WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
While President Bush is proposing a major increase in spending to
defend against bioterrorism, other public health programs, ranging
from preventing chronic diseases and birth defects to controlling
infectious diseases, would be cut under the 2003 budget the White
House unveiled on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Excluding money for bioterrorism, the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, the nation's public health agency, would
receive roughly a $340 million cut under the president's budget,
bringing its non-bioterrorism budget to about $4.1 billion, down from
more than $4.4 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
``To be perfectly candid with you, we had to make some tough
decisions,'' Tommy G. Thompson, the secretary for health and human
services, said at a briefing Monday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Overall, the president is requesting $489 billion for the Health and
Human Services Department, a 6.3 percent increase over 2002. The vast
agency, which oversees the nation's welfare and Medicare programs as
well as the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug
Administration and the disease control centers, accounts for nearly
one-quarter of all federal spending, Thompson said.
</P>
<P>
In his proposal, the president lives up to his commitment to complete
a five-year initiative begun by the Clinton administration to double
the budget of the National Institutes of Health. Bush has requested an
increase of $3.7 billion, or 15.7 percent, for that agency, bringing
its overall budget to $27.4 billion.
</P>
<P>
Mark B. McClellan, a member of the president's Council of Economic
Advisers, said the increase reflects Bush's belief that the
institutes, which finance pioneering biomedical research, provide
taxpayers with a high rate of return on their investment.
</P>
<P>
But the increase is not distributed evenly across the various
institutes that make up the NIH. Nearly half of it, or $1.5 billion,
is devoted to new research on bioterrorism, primarily at the National
Institute on Allergy and Infectious Diseases.
</P>
<P>
That agency, which is trying to develop a new vaccine against anthrax,
would receive the biggest funding boost, an increase of $1.4 billion
over its $2.5 billion budget in 2002. The second-biggest increase
would go to the National Cancer Institute, which would receive an
additional $515 million, bringing its total budget to $4.7 billion.
</P>
<P>
The budget calls for the disease control centers to spend $1.6 billion
on bioterrorism preparedness next year. That is a decrease of $661
million from 2002, but the drop reflects the agency's purchase this
year of $757 million worth of pharmaceuticals and vaccines, a one-time
expenditure in the wake of Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
The disease control centers' bioterrorism budget includes $100 million
for a new lab at the agency's branch in Fort Collins, Colo., as well
as $940 million to improve state and local preparedness, the same
amount the agency will spend in 2002.
</P>
<P>
While public health officials view bioterrorism preparedness as
important, they cautioned on Monday that it should not come at the
expense of other programs. They note that just five Americans have
been killed by bioterrorism over the last year, but thousands die each
year of chronic illnesses and infectious disease.
</P>
<P>
``We will be very concerned if we are funding one thing at the expense
of another,'' said Georges C. Benjamin, president of the Association
of State and Territorial Health Officials. ``If you really want to
push people towards better health, you have got to keep these programs
in place.''
</P>
<P>
At Monday's briefing, Thompson described himself as ``passionate''
about disease prevention, and he pledged that his agency will
``aggressively take on preventing the onset of diseases such as
diabetes,'' which can be prevented through diet and exercise.
</P>
<P>
But the budget proposal calls for a $57 million cut in the disease
control center's program for chronic disease prevention and health
promotion. Infectious disease control, meanwhile, would be cut by $10
million, at a time when public health officials are particularly
concerned about the threat of new and emerging infections.
</P>
<P>
Financing will remain flat for a number of other programs, including
those devoted to childhood immunization, environmental health,
preventing birth defects and sexually transmitted diseases, including
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Marsha Martin, executive director of AIDS Action, complained that Bush
is sending ``a clear message that our nation's public health has
fallen off the administration's radar screen.''
</P>
<P>
She added, ``Homeland security also means investing in prevention and
care services for people at risk and living with HIV.''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The administration had already announced much of its major new
spending for health care in Monday's budget, including $190 billion
over 10 years to ``modernize'' Medicare and create a prescription drug
benefit for the program's elderly beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
Prospects for major action on Medicare are considered poor this year,
given the deep divisions between Republicans and Democrats, budget
constraints and the impending midterm election. Thompson, however,
said on Monday that he remained optimistic.
</P>
<P>
``I understand everyone has written the obituaries for Medicare reform
this year,'' he said. ``I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
The administration also reiterated its proposal, first raised during
the campaign, to use tax credits to help the uninsured buy coverage _
$89 billion over 10 years. The White House also considers community
health centers to be an important means of reaching the uninsured, and
Thompson proposed a $114 million increase for such centers in the new
budget, raising their funding to $1.5 billion.
