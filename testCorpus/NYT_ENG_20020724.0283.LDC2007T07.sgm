NEW CDC LEADER HEADS TO THE HILL
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON
</P>
<P>
The new director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
Dr. Julie L. Gerberding, talked quietly and deliberately about
bioterror Wednesday amid the stately columns and ornate drapery of a
U.S. Capitol reception room. Even House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt
and a gaggle of staffers clattering through didn't break her
attention.
</P>
<P>
In her first visit to the Hill since being appointed this month,
Gerberding had good reason to stay focused. She needed to get
acquainted with Washington leaders and legislators who will help
define the roles of the CDC and other agencies in homeland security.
</P>
<P>
Bioterrorism, ``is close to all our issues being discussed right
now,'' Gerberding said after a nearly 40-minute meeting with Rep.
Saxby Chambliss, R-Ga., chairman of a homeland security subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
During a two-day trip, Gerberding also met with Georgia's Democratic
senators, Max Cleland and Zell Miller.
</P>
<P>
The need for more funding to improve infrastructure at the agency's
Atlanta headquarters was paramount in Wednesday's discussion,
Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the CDC operates on a $6.8 billion budget. It is slated to
receive a significant chunk of the $300 million recently earmarked for
bioterrorism research by Congress and the White House. Chambliss said
specific funding increase amounts were not discussed.
</P>
<P>
``CDC is the front line of the war on bioterrorism,'' said Chambliss.
``More funds are needed to improve the quality of the buildings that
we're asking some of the best researchers in the world to work in.''
</P>
<P>
Building improvements were high on the agenda when Gerberding met with
Cleland as well.
</P>
<P>
``We talked at length about getting the CDC's buildings and facilities
project funded by Congress as quickly as possible,'' Cleland said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to discussing bioterrorism and the need for better
facilities , Gerberding said she came, ``to make it clear that serving
the CDC's millions of constituents is our focus right now.''
</P>
<P>
Like many other federal agency directors have this month, Gerberding
stressed that addressing security threats shouldn't come at the
expense of nonterrorism functions. Previously, Gerberding has said
that AIDS research and prevention efforts remain as important as
combatting small pox and anthrax.
</P>
<P>
The 2-hour flight between Atlanta and Washington will soon become a
weekly occurrence for Gerberding. As she did this week, she plans to
meet that often with Health and Human Services Secretary Tommy
Thompson and leaders at the National Institute for Occupational Safety
and Health.
</P>
<P>
Establishing a better connection between the two cities is essential,
Chambliss said, since the CDC is the only federal agency not
headquartered in Washington. In the upcoming months and years there
will be an unprecedented increase in activity at the centers, he said.
</P>
<P>
Efforts to keep the Atlanta agency connected with Washington,
especially its parent department, have not always been successful in
the past, Chambliss said.
</P>
<P>
``There have been conversations from time to time about having more of
a direct Washington-Atlanta connection,'' he said. But visits like
this week's offer evidence, ``that the CDC is in Atlanta to stay.''
</P>
<P>
The 46-year-old Gerberding is an infectious disease specialist who
served as the agency's spokeswoman during last fall's anthrax
outbreak. She became one of the agency's three interim directors after
Dr. Jeffrey Koplan resigned from the director's post in March.
</P>
<P>
Cleland said Gerberding's experience last fall makes her ``the best
person to be leading the CDC in what will likely be one of the most
challenging periods in its history.''
