PATHOLOGIST'S TESTIMONY A BLOW TO DEFENSE THEORY
</HEADLINE>

REDWOOD CITY, Calif.
</P>
<P>
Some jurors in the Scott Peterson capital-murder trial quietly wiped
away tears as prosecutors showed them gruesome photos Wednesday of the
carcass-like remains of Peterson's wife, Laci, a graphic courtroom
display that drew audible gasps from observers in the gallery.
</P>
<P>
As Assistant District Attorney David Harris flashed pictures of the
badly decomposed, nearly hollow body on a wide screen in the Redwood
City courtroom, Brian Peterson, who conducted the autopsy of Laci
Peterson, listed what was not there.
</P>
<P>
"There were a lot of parts missing. The head, the neck, the forearms
... the lower leg," said Brian Peterson, a forensic pathologist who is
not related to either of the Petersons. "There was no brain to examine
because there was no head. No heart or lungs to examine because the
chest was empty. No liver or kidneys because the abdomen was empty."
</P>
<P>
In fact, the only organ present was the uterus of the eight-months-
pregnant woman. The pathologist used the uterus to debunk a defense
team theory that the couple's unborn child could not possibly have
been born naturally or by cesarean section.
</P>
<P>
Two jurors and an alternate wiped their eyes. Several female jurors
and alternates showed visible signs of discomfort, raising their hands
to cover their mouths. One rocked back and forth in her chair, while
another repeatedly tapped her fingers on the arm of her chair.
</P>
<P>
Peterson, the 31-year-old former fertilizer salesman accused of his
wife's and their unborn child's murders, swallowed hard several times
during the showing of the photos but never looked up from the
defendant's table.
</P>
<P>
His mother, Jackie, sitting in the front row of the gallery, held a
spiral notebook to the side of her face to block her view of her
daughter-in-law's remains. The family of Laci Peterson has not been in
court this week because they wanted to avoid seeing any graphic images
of their slain daughter, who disappeared before Christmas 2002.
</P>
<P>
Her body and that of the Petersons' unborn son washed ashore four
months later on the Richmond shoreline. Peterson maintains his
innocence. He says he used his boat to go fishing in the bay off the
Berkeley Marina on Dec. 24, 2002, the day Laci Peterson disappeared,
and when he returned, his wife was missing.
</P>
<P>
Brian Peterson, who has performed some 5,500 autopsies during his
career, said he was unable to determine the cause of Laci Peterson's
death, but noted during the autopsy that two of her ribs were
fractured. He could not tell if the breaks occurred before or after
she died.
</P>
<P>
The pathologist said he also looked for signs that the missing body
parts were cut off with a weapon or tool, but found none. He theorized
that they may have broken off by the tides and currents in the bay or
eaten by marine life. The only organ still preserved in the victim's
body was her uterus, which was stretched and thin, indicating Laci
Peterson's pregnancy, the pathologist said.
</P>
<P>
After viewing both the uterus and cervix, which was tightly closed, he
concluded that the 27-year-old woman did not give birth to a baby, nor
did she deliver a child by cesarean section. The most likely
explanation of how her baby exited her body was through the top of her
uterus, he said. The baby's largely intact body washed ashore several
days before Laci Peterson's was found.
</P>
<P>
The pathologist's conclusion was a blow to a defense team theory that
Laci Peterson was kidnapped and her baby cut out from her body by an
unknown assailant. Defense attorney Mark Geragos maintains someone who
is not his client later dumped the two bodies where Scott Peterson
said he went fishing in an effort to frame him. But the pathologist
testified the uterus appeared torn, not cut with a tool.
</P>
<P>
The pathologist could not say how long Laci Peterson's body was
submerged but noted that one of her legs was covered with barnacles,
indicating the body had been in the water for some time.
</P>
<P>
Legal analysts following the trial said the photographs were among
some of the most horrific autopsy images they had ever seen and
undoubtedly sent a strong message to jurors.
</P>
<P>
"The prosecution wants to bring home to the jurors that this is not
just a game being played by lawyers in a courtroom," said Dean
Johnson, a former prosecutor who has been in the courtroom throughout
the trial. "You need to bring home the fact that these were real
people who really died a horrible death."
</P>
<P>
Earlier Wednesday, a piece of the story Scott Peterson told police
crumbled when an expert witness testified that concrete found on
Peterson's driveway didn't match a sample taken from the anchor he
made for his boat.
</P>
<P>
In a taped conversation played earlier for jurors, Peterson said he
told police that he made a single anchor for his new boat and used the
remainder of an 80-pound bag of concrete mix for repairs on his
driveway at his Modesto home. Prosecutors maintain the extra concrete
was used to pin his pregnant wife's body to the bottom of San
Francisco Bay.
</P>
<P>
Despite repeated searches of the bay, authorities have never found the
anchors they were looking for.
</P>
<P>
Robert O'Neill, a licensed geologist and expert in construction
materials, said the sample police took from Peterson's driveway
contained large coarse articles not found in the anchor taken from his
boat.
</P>
<P>
Peterson's attorney tried to explain away the difference during cross-
examination, suggesting that the concrete found near the driveway had
been mixed with gravel, creating the variation. But O'Neill dismissed
that theory, saying Geragos' theory wasn't possible: The rocks weren't
added as he suggested but were part of the original mix.
