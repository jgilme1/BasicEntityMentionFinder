ATLANTA -- The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention employees
receiving the most frequent large cash awards and performance bonuses
are not scientists, but mostly budget analysts, accountants, computer
experts and other administrative managers, according to an analysis of
the awards by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
As the CDC faces morale problems and the loss of key scientific
leaders, the distribution awards provides evidence, critics say, that
the Atlanta-based agency is becoming more focused on management and
bureaucracy and less on its public health mission.
</P>
<P>
The 72 CDC employees who received five or more awards of at least
$2,500 from 2000 through July 21, primarily work in non-science jobs.
Some got $30,000, $50,000 and in one case more than $140,000 in
cumulative bonus cash beyond their salaries , according to the CDC's
awards data, obtained by the Journal-Constitution under the Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
The CDC has about 9,000 employees, and 4,200 of them are considered
scientific staffers. The highest individual annual performance bonus
paid so far this year was $27,000 to a manager of a scientific
division, the data show.
</P>
<P>
CDC Director Julie Gerberding was unavailable for comment Friday and
Saturday. Other CDC officials said the agency is examining its system
of awarding employees for fairness, appropriateness and transparency.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make sure that the system we have in place is equitable
and that it rewards everyone, if in fact they are eligible for the
award and if in fact they're deserving of it," said spokesman Tom
Skinner. "We are looking at the system and anything we can do to make
it better."
</P>
<P>
Low morale and an exodus of key leaders and scientists from CDC since
2004 has caused significant concern among several of the agency's
former directors and drawn the attention of a congressional committee.
</P>
<P>
The fear is that turmoil within the agency may be harming its ability
to handle public health emergencies - from bioterrorism attacks, to an
influenza pandemic to the toll of obesity, the Journal-Constitution
reported last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, all but two of the directors of the CDC's
eight primary scientific centers will have left the agency. Other
high-profile departures include world experts in several diseases.
</P>
<P>
The agency's cash awards program is one tool in its arsenal that can
be used to improve morale and stem departures. Yet the distribution of
frequent large cash awards mainly to budget and administrative staff
and managers is an example of how the agency has become increasingly
enamored of its non-scientific staff, said three current CDC
employees, who declined to speak publicly for this article.
</P>
<P>
Last year, a CDC poll of its employees, called Pulse Check, found that
one of their top concerns was the "loss of public health focus/mission
in exchange for inappropriate business focus."
</P>
<P>
Feds step up awards
</P>
<P>
Giving cash awards and performance bonuses is a longstanding practice
in the federal government, though it has received increased emphasis
in recent years.
</P>
<P>
"The government is trying hard to move to a performance-sensitive
compensation system," said John Palguta, vice president of the
Partnership for Public Service, an independent nonprofit Washington-
based group that specializes in federal work force issues. "The notion
is that employees should be compensated not for breathing, but rather
for what they contribute to the organization and their level of
performance."
</P>
<P>
Skinner and other CDC officials said there may be several reasons that
frequent, large awards are skewed in favor of financial staff and
administrative managers.
</P>
<P>
One theory is that not all front-line managers may be aware of or
regularly use the awards. Another theory is that the President's
Management Agenda for all federal agencies has stressed improving the
performance of budget systems, technology and the like.
</P>
<P>
"There wasn't a parallel big initiative on the science side," said
Glen Nowak, another CDC spokesman. "That probably is a contributing
factor here."
</P>
<P>
Another factor, agency officials said, is that about 800 of the CDC's
4,200 scientific employees are members of the U.S. Public Health
Service Commissioned Corps, a uniformed service that operates under a
different personnel system and is not eligible for the awards. A group
of about 600 "distinguished" scientists are in another employee
classification that did not become eligible for annual performance
awards until last fall, they said.
</P>
<P>
Cash awards given to CDC and other federal employees break into two
general categories: special act cash awards that reward an individual
or a group for specific accomplishment or activity; and annual
performance bonuses, tied to an employee's overall performance rating
and involve a percentage of the person's salary that varies in size
and availability depending on how the employee is classified.
</P>
<P>
The CDC distributed about 2,500 special act and performance awards
worth at least $2,500 since 2000 to about 1,450 individuals. About 560
employees received two or more of these awards, and 72 of them
received five or more awards, according to the CDC data.
</P>
<P>
-- Three employees - a financial systems branch chief, a deputy
director of budget and management, and another budget official -
received the most checks, at 10 awards each. Their cumulative awards
totaled $35,000, $34,326 and $32,000 respectively.
</P>
<P>
-- Five employees - people working in facilities operations, budget,
accounting and technical information - received nine awards each.
Their cumulative totals ranged from $25,326 to $50,565.
</P>
<P>
-- Of 16 employees receiving seven or eight awards, one is a health
science supervisor. The rest are financial managers, accounting
staffers, or work in security or other administrative positions.
</P>
<P>
Most of these checks were special act cash awards. And some of the
staffers have received three or four such checks in a single year.
</P>
<P>
Palguta said it seemed unusual for employees to receive multiple cash
awards for acts that are supposed to be "above and beyond" their
normal duties.
</P>
<P>
"Sometimes employees may see one over a five-year period. If they're
really exceptional, maybe they'll see one for every two or three
years," he said. "But if somebody were to receive two cash awards a
year and each year for a five-year period, that would be higher than
average, I'd say."
</P>
<P>
Despite requests for more details on the awards, CDC officials did not
release copies of the award nomination and justification forms for the
most frequent recipients of high awards. The newspaper also sought the
information in its Freedom of Information Act request filed on July 3.
</P>
<P>
Gerberding has received two $5,000 special act cash awards since
becoming director of the agency in July 2002: one in February 2005 and
the other in December 2005. A CDC spokesman said he did not have
details of those awards.
</P>
<P>
Bill Gimson, the CDC's chief operating officer, said he did not know
whether the CDC's practice of giving multiple special act cash awards
to some of its employees is unusual. But he said the agency will be
looking into that question. "We are constantly attempting to re-
evaluate and evaluate how equitable" the awards are, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The CDC budget and accounting staff for the last four years have been
implementing a major $60 million accounting system," Gimson said,
which may explain why so many of those employees have been frequent
recipients of special act cash awards.
</P>
<P>
An elite classification
</P>
<P>
The highest single checks in most years have been in the form of
annual performance bonuses to CDC staffers who are part of an elite
federal employee classification, called the senior executive service.
There are about 30 such employees at the CDC, including Gimson and
Gerberding.
</P>
<P>
These executives, as in all agencies, can qualify for an annual
performance bonus of up to 12 percent of their base salaries, which at
the CDC range from $109,808 to $165,200. Across all federal agencies,
about 55 percent of senior executives receive some level of annual
performance award.
</P>
<P>
Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association, which
represents career federal executives in all agencies, said the
performance bonus system is meant to ensure government can attract and
retain top talent.
</P>
<P>
"The people who do the work these executives do in the private sector
and even the nonprofit world can earn at least 150 percent of what
these people earn in government," she said. "Having said that, they
don't come into government because of the pay."
</P>
<P>
In 2005, eight of the CDC's senior executives received annual
performance bonuses of $15,000 to $19,000. Another eight received
bonuses of $11,000 to $15,000.
</P>
<P>
A handful of these CDC senior executives have qualified, based on
their performance evaluation and nomination by committees at the CDC
and the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, for prestigious
Presidential Rank Awards. Just 1 percent of all federal senior
executives each year are eligible to receive one of these awards for
"distinguished" service - a prize check that is written for 35 percent
of their salary. Five percent of all federal senior executives each
year can receive one of these awards for "meritorious" service, and it
comes with a check for 20 percent of the individual's salary.
</P>
<P>
An employee can receive each of these awards only once, and Gimson,
has done that - helping make him one of the agency's most frequent and
highest recipients of various cash awards.
</P>
<P>
Since July 2002, he has received seven awards over $2,500 of various
types totaling $147,863.
</P>
<P>
Gimson received a Presidential Rank Award for meritorious service in
2002 for $24,740 and one for distinguished service last fall for
$55,368. The first award recognized his work in the CDC's financial
management office, the second his leadership at Chief Operating
Officer in helping the CDC to achieve top ratings on aspects of the
President's Management Agenda.
</P>
<P>
"I really feel that it's extremely important to recognize all of out
top performing employees," Gimson said. And that means staff that work
in science, programs, management and administrative areas, he said.
</P>
<P>
Since they became eligible for annual performance awards in October
2005, CDC employees who are classified as "distinguished" scientists
started receiving some large individual checks beginning this past
spring.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Douglas received a performance bonus in March, for $27,000,
for his outstanding performance as director of the CDC's division of
sexually transmitted disease prevention.
</P>
<P>
"I think it's incredibly important in an organizational environment to
be appreciated," said Douglas. He said that as a manager, he finds
that cash awards of varying types help make sure employees know their
hard work is recognized. "Some of our biggest awards have been to
people who stepped into acting positions and are basically doing a job
and a half or two jobs. I can't pay them two salaries. Frankly, some
of them deserve it."
</P>
<P>
Twenty other CDC employees like Douglas, who are classified as
"distinguished" scientists, have received performance bonuses of
$10,000 or more so far this year, and six of them received $20,000 to
$27,000 each.
</P>
<P>
The CDC spends about $865 million on salaries and benefits in a year.
Last year, the agency paid out about $15 million in awards of all
types and amounts.
</P>
<P>
Awards and performance bonuses have consistently represented about 1.6
percent of the CDC's salary and benefits costs since 2000, said Nowak,
the CDC spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Nowak said about 56 percent of all awards of $2,500 or more go toward
the agency's scientific staff.
</P>
<P>
CDC officials, however, did not respond to the newspaper's requests
for details of how they arrived at that number given that the agency's
database does not clearly delineate between the categories and that
some staff titles are ambiguous.
