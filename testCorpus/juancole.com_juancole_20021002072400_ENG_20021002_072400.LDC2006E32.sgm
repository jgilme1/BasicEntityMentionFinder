Mr. Cole is professor of Middle Eastern and South Asian History at the
University of Michigan and author of Sacred Space and Holy War (I.B.
Tauris, 2002). His website is: www.juancole.com.

Harvard President Lawrence Summers has equated favoring university
divestment from Israeli stocks with anti-Semitism. Summers has for
some time misunderstood the duties of his office to include bullying
professors, and in this recent equation he is profoundly wrong. He and
others who are taking this tack are also pursuing an extremely
dangerous and troubling course with dire implications for civil
liberties.

In twentieth century American history, Jews were excluded from
admission to some private universities, denied the right to rent or
buy certain houses, and suffered from false stereotypes. Prominent
Americans like Henry Ford spewed vile slanders about them. These
bigoted exclusions were profoundly wrong, as were those visited on
African-Americans and Asian-Americans.

Prejudice and discrimination against Jews is iconic of ethnic hatred
because of the Nazi holocaust. The Holocaust makes the dangers of a
pervasive hatred of a particular people palpable, and for that reason
it is a deeply human event, in the sense that it affects all
humankind. The cry of "Never again" is a key support in the struggles
of all civil libertarians and human rights workers.

But some use "Never again" in a far more disturbing way, as a warrant
for imprisoning, crushing or dispersing the Palestinian people. The
state of Israel is a project of Jewish nationalism that is as
legitimate as any other national project. But Israel as a state is not
perfect and cannot be above criticism in democratic societies,
including practical criticism.

The Israeli state is in violation the Fourth Geneva Convention of 1949
(which forbids the mistreatment of civilian populations under military
occupation), and of too many Security Council resolutions to list. The
government of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon seems intent on
seizing more Palestinian land. Over a fifth of Palestinian children
under Israeli occupation are acutely or chronically malnourished,
according to US AID and the United Nations.

Ariel Sharon's arrogant trampling on the basic human rights of
Palestinians is often justified by reference to the horrible incidents
of terrorism suffered by Israel in the past two years. These suicide
bombings are unspeakable. A sober estimation of their impact, however,
would reveal that about 300 Israelis have died in them per year. More
innocent Palestinian civilians, including women and children, have
been killed in Israeli military action against the terrorists than
have Israeli civilians in the terrorist attacks. The terrorists have
amounted to a few dozen individuals, whereas almost all the 3.2
million Palestinians in the occupied territories have been peaceful.

Israel's current harsh lockdown of the entire West Bank would not be
countenanced in other similar international situations. Would the
United Kingdom have been justified in militarily occupying all of
Ireland and keeping all Irish under strict curfew in their houses
because of the terrorist attacks of the Irish Republican Army? In the
1970s, after all, the Northern Irish death toll was similar to what
Israel has suffered in the past two years. It is hard not to conclude
that a certain amount of racism toward west Asians like the
Palestinians allows the world to turn a blind eye to such collective
punishment.

Sharon's policies are widely perceived in the rest of the world to be
an extension of those of the United States. A U.S. F-16 was used by
Israel to attack a terrorist leader in an apartment building full of
civilians, resulting in numerous civilian deaths. The footage of such
events is shown repeatedly throughout the Middle East. The U.S.
government keeps silent about Israeli human rights abuses. Sharon's
iron fist is creating waves of new anti-Americanism in the rest of the
world at a time when our country is still reeling from the September
11 attacks and attempting to dampen the flames of terrorism. With
friends like Ariel Sharon, who needs enemies?

University communities have very little impact on world affairs and
can exercise influence only through writing or through local campus
actions. The false and monstrous equation of practical criticism of
Ariel Sharon's policies with anti-Semitism is designed to silence
voices critical of those policies, and to make the divestment movement
look as though it were motivated merely by bigotry.

In the 1980s, many campuses saw a successful campaign for divestment
against South Africa, a racist regime with which U.S. and Israel
governments and industry at times collaborated. Only fringe voices
would have suggested that the campaign was animated by prejudice
against white people or by anti-Semitism. Summers's statements are
most urgently dangerous because they cheapen the phrase "anti-
Semitism," and thereby weaken its force and its power in the struggle
for civil liberties and human rights for everyone.
