Iran's Supreme Jurisprudent, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, said in a radio
address that: 'The American nation should know that Iraq is America's
quagmire and America is sinking deeper into it by staying longer in
Iraq . . . The Americans are so desperate that they are bombing an
occupied country...this (Middle East) region does not tolerate
occupation . . . 'The Americans should know that any imposed
government, constitution and elections would face resistance from the
people in Iraq. In free elections the majority of the Iraqi people
will choose those who will not allow the Americans to stay one more
day in Iraq. The Americans, who entered Iraq in the name of human
rights, have oppressed the Iraqis so much that they punched the
Americans in the face. The Americans' claim about bringing democracy
to the region is a disgraceful lie.'' (Reuters).

I have to admit that the line about the US being reduced to bombing a
country it had already militarily occupied was a pretty good zinger.
Iranian politics is rough and tumble, and these battle hardened old
ayatollahs have the sharp elbow moves choreographed as well as any WWF
wrestler. The scarey thing is that Khamenei could turn up the heat on
the US in Iraq pretty easily, and it is hard to see what the Bush
administration could do about it. It is not as if they have the spare
troops to attack and occupy Iran as well (despite Billy Kristol's
disturbed daydreams).
