I first wrote about Zeyad and his Healing Iraq weblog in early
November .

It had been such a welcome change to get news of Iraq directly from
someone who actually lived there, that I felt the future of real news
gathering and dissemination lay with weblogs. As of today, I'm
absolutely sure of it.

On Wednesday, December 11, ten thousand people, including tribal
leaders and polititians demonstrated against terrorism in Baghdad and
no major publication picked up on this significant milestone in the
rebuilding of Iraq.

However, a tiny counter-demonstration by a group of Al-Sadr supporters
attempting to hijack the demonstration was deemed newsworthy by major
media.

If not for Zeyad and other Iraqi webloggers, we would have never heard
about this epic demonstration. Zeyad now has a digital camera and he
has posted more than fifty pictures of the people at this
demonstration. One thing I noticed is that this event was led,
organized and protected by Iraqis. Here is an excerpt from Zeyad's
post of December 11:

The rallies today proved to be a major success. I didn't expect
anything even close to this. It was probably the largest demonstration
in Baghdad for months. It wasn't just against terrorism. It was
against Arab media, against the interference of neighbouring
countries, against dictatorships, against Wahhabism, against
oppression, and of course against the Ba'ath and Saddam.

We started at Al-Fatih square in front of the Iraqi national theatre
at 10 am. IP were all over the place. At 12 pm people started marching
towards Fardus square through Karradah. All political parties
represented in the GC participated. But the other parties,
organizations, unions, tribal leaders, clerics, school children,
college students, and typical everyday Iraqis made up most of the
crowd. Al-Jazeera estimated the size of the crowd as over ten thousand
people.

You can find a list of some of the parties that we noticed there at
Omar's blog. At one point it struck me that our many differences as an
Iraqi people meant nothing. Here we were all together shouting in
different languages the same slogans "NO NO to terrorism, YES YES for
peace".

Visit his weblog and see the pictures for yourselves. You may draw the
same conclusions that I did. We have given these people a chance for a
better life and they are responding to it in a way that bodes well for
their future.

I look to weblogs from now on for news of Iraq or any other issues
that major western media outlets cannot report honestly. Interesting
to note that a few regional papers in the US did carry this story.
It's nice to know that there are still a few professional journalists
out there.

UPDATE:

Chris Muir has captured the sorry state of American media perfectly.
Thanks to Instapundit for the link.

UPDATE No. 2: Chris had commented on another network earlier. You have
to judge for yourself how close to the mark he was.

It may be possible that we will look back on this period and decide
that the succinct summation of events by cartoonists gave us the most
accurate, and memorable historical records of pivotal events. That
cartoon really sums it up, doesn't it? I am SO happy for the people fo
Iraq. Like you, I just knew that they would heal with enough time and
shelter. Thank you so much for the comment you left for me yesterday.

virtual aunties and uncles. Don't think she didn't love it! Love to

Even though I am against the war and George Bush, through the media
there seems to be only the bad news coming out of Iraq . It is good to
see something where the Iraqi's, at least, seem to have a voice of
their own, and they are looking towards the future--a different sort
of future without Sadaam. Freedom is power. gale aka anonymous gurl.

I dont' like media-bashing. Really. It can get annoying. But their
willful(?) ignoring of this event is so ... so ... Orwellian.
